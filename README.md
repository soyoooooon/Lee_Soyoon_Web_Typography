I have got some weird issue with git hub.
it says my pdf file is large, so I got rid of pdf file, but it still keeps saying my pdf file is large when I try to commit. so I did manually on git hub site.
Also, when I try to commit, it is extremely slow.

I'd like to let you know about this problem.

Thanks a lot
